    "# 1. Employee and ProductionWorker Classes\n",
    "Write an Employee class that keeps data attributes for the following pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Employee name\n",
    "\n",
    "• Employee number\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is a subclass of the Employee class. \n",
    "The ProductionWorker class should keep data attributes for the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Shift number (an integer, such as 1, 2, or 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Hourly pay rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift attribute will hold an \n",
    "integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the \n",
    "night shift is shift 2. Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have written the classes, write a program that creates an object of the \n",
    "ProductionWorker class and prompts the user to enter data for each of the object’s data \n",
    "attributes. Store the data in the object, then use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve it \n",
    "and display it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem I first created a basic Employee class with data attributes of name and id number and the respective accessor and mutator methods. Then I created ProductionWorker class as a subclass of Employee so it inherits the employee name and id number data attributes and methods. I saved these definitions in employee.py so I can imporrt them into my program. I wrote the get_shift accessor method so that it takes a data attribute either 1 or 2 and has an if statement that returns a string either \"Day Shift\" or \"Night Shift\". Then I wrote a basic program that creates an object of the production worker class and then uses the accessors methods to display the objects data. "

For the get_bonus accessor method I had the user input either y or n depending on if the supervisor earned the bonus, then if the supervisor earned the bonus it calculates the bonus as 5% of the supervisors pay. I wrote a basic program similar to above that creates an object of the subclass and uses the accessor methods to display the data attributes of the object. "
