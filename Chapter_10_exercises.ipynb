    "For this problem I approached it in pieces. First I laid out all the functions I would need like menu and delete employee. Then I slowly used my notes and the book to fill out those functions one at a time. I made global constants for menu choices and filename to make main look cleaner. I made a function called dict_open that creates or opens an existing dictionary. I made a seperate menu function that gets the users choice and then returns it to main. Then in main there are a if and elif statements to figure out what choice the player made. If the user wants to update info then the function change_employee is called where you can enter the employees ID number and change the attributes of that employees object. Same if you call the delete, look_up, and add_employee functions, they all update the employee dictionary. When the user is done and enters 5 to quit the program it pickles the dictionary for saving and closes it."
